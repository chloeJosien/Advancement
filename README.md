This is to help FTC teams calculate the points an event goes on.
All points are allocated as specified by the 2025-2026 FIRST Tech Challenge game manual that can be found at

Planned upgrades
* get information from ftc-events
* combo of manual file upload and calling ftc-events
* build a UI (web then app maybe)

**Choices made**

React vs ThymeLeaf

React:
* Separate code base from the backend logic
* requires more set up 
* more widely used in industry
* Uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS

ThymeLeaf:
* Can be created within the same project as the backend logic
* simpler to set up and run
* less known about
* HTML and CSS only

For this project since the FTC team I work with does not begin competing
until early December, I'm choosing to build this UI in React as also to teach myself
more front-end focused languages. If this needed to be done quickly I would have chosen ThymeLeaf.
